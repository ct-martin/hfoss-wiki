# HFOSS final project

## Goal

Your final goal is to write an 
[Activity](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activities)
that targets US 4th grade math curriculum.

## Resources

You can try to pick something to address from
this [curriculum chart](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Math4Team/Resources/Curriculum_Chart)
on the Sugarlabs Wiki. You are not restricted to using this, but it is an
option.

You may find the [NY State math standards](http://www.p12.nysed.gov/ciai/mst/math/standards/revisedg4.html) 
helpful.

Though out-of-date in several respects, this guide to developing a desktop
activity for the XO
by IBM is a good general overview to [using a separate development environment](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/tutorials/l-sugarpy/)

The Sugarlabs Github organization holds more recent [documentation for contributing to Sugar](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs)
This provides pointers for desktop and web activities.

You may wish to start by building some easy first project examples, [Hello World](https://github.com/sugarlabs/hello-world) and [Sugar quickstart](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/sugar-quickstart)

## Steps

### Form a team.
Seek a diverse set of skills in your team.

### Propose a project.
Be sure to note what curricular components are included.
Assign roles to team members.

### Request a SugarLabs Wiki account
Have at least one team member [request an account](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin)
for the wiki. **_This is a manual process so please begin right away._**

### Demonstrate some proof-of-concept

### Demonstrate a prototype

### Demonstrate final game




Team Assessments 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-   200-1000 words per teammate.
-   Indicate what they did to contribute to the project.
-   What skills did they pick up this semester?
-   What skills should they develop further?
-   Give a numeric score (1-10) for them and justify it.
-   These must be emailed to the
    [instructor](mailto:deejoe@mail.rit.edu) They will remain private.

Final Presentation 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Your presentations should last 10 minutes with another 5 minutes for
discussion.

Your team will need to present from the front of the room. 

Every member of your team needs to speak for a roughly equal amount of the presentation. Be prepared.

Give a demonstration of your project.

How does the code work?

-   What are some of the best pieces of software you wrote? Why?
-   What are some of the worst pieces? Why?

What stumbling blocks were there? What successes?

What would you have done differently?

What would you have worked on if you'd had more time?

**Your Presentation will be graded on aspects such as:**

-   Presentation Skills (Projection, Posture, Body Language)
-   Grammar/Spelling
-   Design (colorschemes, graphics, look/feel)
-   Timing (significantly over/under time limit)
-   Content (quality/quantity of information)
-   Adherence to Guidelines (Did you hit all the bullet points in this list?)


Finished Project 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-   Add a fully-fleshed out entry and link to your project information to this wiki page (Use the examples already there as a standard for the quality of your addition): `http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Math4Team/RIT/Projects`

Your grade here will be derived from the following factors:

-   Is the code clearly licensed under an OSI-compatible license?
-   Does your source repository contain clear written instructions for future developers? (i.e. How to setup their environment to work on your project)
-   What TODO items are left to do?
-   Does it work on python on a normal machine?
-   Does it work on Sugar?
-   Code quality and git commit history.
-   Quality of the wiki entry at sugarlabs.org
